# Magicia Adventures
- Magicia Adventures is an android game developed by me during my project management implementation using Unity platform where the users can play multiple attempts and achieve a certain number of victory points before all other players. 

- A shopkeeper is present in all the levels.

- An enemy is anyone against whom the player contend.
- The Level boss is a significant computer-controlled enemy. Bosses take strategy and special
 knowledge to defeat, such as how to attack weak points or avoid specific attacks.
